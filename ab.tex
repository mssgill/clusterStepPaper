	Shape measurement bias is an important source of error in the 
mass of clusters as determined by weak gravitational lensing. The
cluster mass function as measured by weak lensing for the Dark Energy Survey (DES)
will be used to constrain cosmology, so it is important that shape measurement
bias is well constrained. Comparing the current level of systematic bias of different 
weak lensing pipelines measured on simulated images allows us to model the expected error
in the cluster mass measurement for the stacked weak lensing result.
     The accuracy of the shape measurement pipelines is determined from image simulations
that have the expected distribution of galaxy properties that will be observed by DES. Eight 
different shape measurement pipelines, including several which have not competed in previous
image simulation challenges are included. 
      The best performing weak lensing pipelines exhibit a multiplicative bias of several percent, 
that is stable as a function of redshift. This level of shape measurement bias does not have a statisticaly
significant impact on DES cluster cosmology.
