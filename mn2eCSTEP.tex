\begin{abstract}
We present results from the Cluster Shear TEsting Program (CSTEP), an image
analysis challenge to measure weak gravitational shear in
the cluster regime. Shape measurement bias is an important source of systematic error in the 
measurement of cluster masses by weak gravitational lensing and,
consequently, cluster cosmology. In this work the accuracy of eight shape measurement pipelines is determined from image simulations
that have realistic distributions of galaxy properties and large gravitational shear. The best
performing methods exhibit a multiplicative bias of a few percent that
is stable as a function of redshift. Our results also show that the
methods tested here do not have a strong quadratic bias. We find
that the shear bias due to selection effects varies widely
among the methods. We model the impact of the
biases found on a simulated stage III optical weak lensing cluster cosmology survey, such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and find it to
be below the statistical uncertainty. Current shape measurement methods are therefore suitable for upcoming cluster lensing data sets, particularly when tested and calibrated by realistic image simulations.

\section{Introduction}
A primary cosmological probe is the number and distribution in mass of galaxy
clusters in a given volume of space \citep[cf.][for a recent review]{Allen}. There are a number
of different tools to detect clusters, including the presence of red cluster member galaxies or the X-ray and SZ signal of hot intra-cluster gas, but these
methods provide observables which must first be connected to cluster mass before they can be used for cosmology. One method of achieving this is 
weak lensing. Large optical surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES)
(http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) are able to detect and measure the
mass of large numbers of clusters and place strong constraints on the
halo mass function if sources of systematic error can be controlled.
Shape measurement pipelines have been developed to remove the 
effect of the PSF and accurately measure the lensing signal, yet are known
to suffer from small biases. As the mass measured from a galaxy cluster depends on the strength of the
shear measured on galaxies behind the cluster, a biased weak lensing
pipeline will lead to a biased determination of the cluster mass.
 
Previous image simulation challenges were used to determine
the accuracy of shape measurement pipelines, e.g.~STEP1 \citep{STEP1},
STEP2 \citep{STEP2}, GREAT08 \citep{GREAT08}, GREAT10
\citep{GREAT10}, and GREAT3 \citep{great3}. The challenges used blinded image
simulations to characterize the shape measurement bias in
different lensing pipelines. All of these challenges have focused on
different aspects of shear estimation, and have led to
improvements in existing shear pipelines. Results from these challenges have been
used to calibrate shape measurement pipelines \citep[e.g.][]{Apple},
and determine that lensing pipelines meet accuracy requirements for scientific
analyses \citep[e.g.][]{Berge}. Although previous challenges provided valuable information on many important
aspects of shear pipeline estimation, they were designed to test the regime of very weak cosmic shear with $|g| \leq 0.06$. 
It is important, however, to also test the accuracy of shape measurement
pipelines in the higher shear regime that occurs around the center of
massive galaxy clusters, where selection effects and non-linear biases
may play a more important role.


The Cluster Shear TEsting Program (CSTEP) is designed to extend image
simulation challenges to the high shear regime and study aspects of
shear estimation that would impact a weak lensing measurement of
cluster mass for a ground based large optical survey. For this, we
simulate ground-based images of galaxies with a realistic
distribution of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), size and ellipticity. Lensing pipelines
were evaluated to determine their shape measurement bias as a
function of these properties. The shape measurement bias as 
determined for each lensing pipeline is then used to model the 
systematic error in the cluster mass for a stacked weak lensing measurement and its impact on cluster cosmology.


In Section 2 we describe the structure of the challenge and the image simulations used in this
project. We outline the characteristics of the shape
measurement pipelines used in this analysis in Section 3. We present
our findings on shape measurement bias including the impact of SNR, selection
effects, quadratic bias and redshift in Section 4. The
effect of shape measurement biases on stacked cluster weak lensing
analyses is discussed in Section 5.  Conclusions from this study are 
given in Section 6.  Finally there is an appendix which contains a more detailed
description of pipelines.

\section{Cluster STEP Challenge}
Gravitational lensing is the distortion of the images of
distant galaxies by the tidal gravitational field of massive structures near
their line of sight. This can
cause a change in the observed shape, size, and brightness of a
galaxy. For massive galaxy clusters this leads to galaxies at a
higher redshift than the cluster often being
observed as arcs (strong lensing) near the cluster center , and to
appear aligned tangentialy with decreasing amount of distortion further from
the cluster center (weak lensing). Since physically unrelated galaxies 
have random orientations, a measurement of the average ellipticity of
an ensemble of galaxies unaffected by gravitational lensing would average
to zero. Measuring the mean tangential alignment of background galaxies therefore provides a way of
measuring the strength of the gravitational lensing signal, and thus the
mass of a galaxy cluster. 

For the larger shears of the cluster regime and analyses assuming radial symmetry, both the quadratic ($q$) and
multiplicative ($m$) shape bias (see eq.~\ref{Eqn:QMC})
affect the measurement to a greater extent than any
constant ($c$) shear bias, since the latter averages to zero when measuring
tangential shear over a full circle. It is
important to quantify the quadratic and multiplicative bias on images
with simulated shear comparable to the shear observed around large
galaxy clusters. The Cluster Shear TEsting Program (CSTEP) tested eight weak lensing pipelines on images of constant shear
($|\gamma| = [0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.15]$) with galaxy and PSF properties that simulate the properties
of data that is being observed with DES. Systematic shape measurement bias was quantified by the $q$, $m$ and $c$
determined by a fit of the quadratic equation.
\begin{equation}\label{Eqn:QMC}
\gamma_m = q (\gamma_t)^2 + (1+m) \gamma_t + c,
\end {equation}
where $\gamma_t$ is the true shear and $\gamma_m$ is the measured
shear. A linear model that has been used to quantify systematic errors
for cosmic shear regimes was also used, defining the biases as \citep{STEP1}
\begin{equation}\label{Eqn:MC}
\gamma_m = (1+m) \gamma_t + c \; .
\end {equation}

An example fit to the im3shape data is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eqfit}.

\section{Evaluation of pipelines}
In this section we evaluate the performance of shape measurement 
pipelines based on a set of criteria important for large cluster weak
lensing studies. The success of a shape measurement pipeline depends
on its ability to accurately measure shear on small faint galaxies, be unbiased
when all galaxies present in an image are used to measure the shear, and
have a shear bias that does not change as a function of the redshift
of the galaxies included in the lensing measurement. A good shape
measurement method would also be able to successfully measure shear on
a high percentage of the galaxy images which it attempts to analyze. 
The relative importance of the above criteria in determining
the best shear measurement pipeline to use may depend both on the 
data being evaluated and the lensing application. A more detailed examination
of the performance of each individual lensing pipeline 
as a function of PSF ellipticity, PSF size, galaxy size, 
and the contribution of selection bias is included in Appendix \ref{App:shpipe}, along
with a description of the algorithms of the shape measurement pipelines. \\

The measure of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) referred to in this section was measured on the CSTEP images
for each galaxy using \textsc{SExtractor}. It is defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{Eqn:SNR_ref}
\textrm{SNR} = \frac{\textrm{Flux}}{\textrm{Flux Error}} \; ,
\end{equation}
where the flux and flux error was determined using ... \green{say FLUX\_AUTO or FLUX\_ISO here and give details on detection threshold in case it's the latter; I don't think the figure adds much since the MJ and I3 definitions of SNR are less common than this one, so I've removed it}.

\green{can you comment here or elsewhere on how you get the error bars on q,m,c? you should probably also mention how you fit for q,m,c (subtracting the mean intrinsic ellipticity of all galaxies as far as I remember, rather than doing a ring-test type thing)}

\section{Stacked cluster weak lensing}
An accurate measurement of the abundance of galaxy clusters within a
given survey volume provides powerful constraints on cosmological
parameters.  While weak lensing can provide individual mass
measurements of high mass clusters, lower mass clusters can only be
measured on average by stacked weak lensing. Stacked weak lensing
measures the mean tangential shear of  background galaxies behind
galaxy clusters which are binned by observable parameters such as
richness. Stacked weak lensing
of clusters in the MaxBCG catalog \citep{Koester, Eshel} on data from the 
Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep{York} has been used to derive
cosmological constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ in
\citep{Ying, ERozo}. Since upcoming surveys such as DES  will include deeper
imaging and better seeing, the constraints on cosmology
from stacked cluster weak lensing will substantially improve if
sources of systematic error can be controlled. \\

There are a number of systematic effects that can bias the
stacked weak lensing mass measurement, and in this paper we focus
on studying the systematic bias in the stacked weak lensing cluster
mass measurement contributed by shape measurement errors. If lensing
pipelines provide a biased measurement of the shear profile of galaxy
clusters this will bias the observed average cluster mass, and bias
the derived cluster abundance function. To model the possible
impact on a DES like survey by shape measurement errors, we take an
average NFW profile for each stacked cluster bin, apply a lensing
bias, and then determine what cluster mass would be measured by
an NFW fitting program. By comparing the true and the measured cluster
mass this provides an estimate of the effect of shape measurement bias
for each lensing pipeline. In this paper we compare the expected statistical errors
expected in a DES like survey stacked weak lensing cluster mass measurement
described in section \ref{sec:p1} to the modeled bias on the mass
from shape measurement errors described in section \ref{sec:p2}. \\
There are several other significant sources of systematic bias for
stacked weak lensing not included in this study. As shown by
\citep{Joerg} if optically detected clusters are binned by richness
they have orientation bias and are not spherically symmetric, which
leads to bias in the measured cluster abundance. Currently
orientation bias will dominate over the statistical error for DES but
it can perhaps be calibrated using simulations, or corrected using
other methods. There are additional sources of possible systematic
error such as photometric errors and cluster miscentering which are 
areas of ongoing research and not discussed in this project.

\section{Summary}
The CSTEP project tested shape measurement pipelines in the cluster
shear regime on simulated data of DES. This project
analyzed the effectiveness of the shear pipelines by several criteria,
and tested the impact shape measurement bias would have on a stacked
cluster weak lensing analysis. \\

In this paper we measured Quadratic, Multiplicative and
Additive bias of galaxy shape estimates for eight shape measurement
pipelines. The shape measurement bias found in several of the pipelines was within the
desired limits of a stacked cluster weak lensing measurement for
DES. In particular the I3 pipeline has consistently good bias properties
across a wide range of simulation input parameters.\\

The results on the simulations showed that the strongest
determination of high bias was a low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). A
low signal to noise ratio occurs when the differentiation between
galaxy boundaries and their background is poor. In contrast, galaxies 
simulated at different redshifts had the same level of bias. An
important finding is based on an analysis of bias as a function of galaxy model
type. For many of the pipelines, and I3 in particular, galaxy
model type has little impact on measures of pipeline bias. \\

The results showed that in general the Quadratic bias was not
significant for most pipelines and that it did not contribute
significantly to the error in the mass measured on stacked cluster
weak lensing profiles. \\

This project has helped determine the properties of pipelines
to be used in DES. The use of the I3 pipeline
finds support by the consistently high quality of the shape
estimates. In addition, the characteristics of bias have been further
clarified, leaving in general bias as a multiplicative function
dominated by Signal to Noise ratio - leading to support of future
multiplicative corrections for Signal to Noise ratio in future
analysis. \\
