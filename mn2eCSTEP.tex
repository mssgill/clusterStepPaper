\begin{abstract}
We present results from the Cluster Shear TEsting Program (CSTEP) , an image
analysis challenge to measure weak gravitational shear distortions in
the cluster shear regime. Shape measurement bias is an important source of systematic error in the 
measurement of galaxy cluster masses by weak gravitational lensing. The
cluster mass function as measured by weak lensing will be one tool
used to constrain cosmology, so it is important that shape measurement
bias is small, and does not bias the measurement of the cluster mass function. Comparing the current level of systematic bias of different 
weak lensing pipelines measured on simulated images allows us to model the expected error
in the cluster mass measurement for the stacked weak lensing
result. The accuracy of the shape measurement pipelines is determined from image simulations
that have the expected distribution of galaxy properties. Eight 
different shape measurement pipelines were tested, and the best performing weak
lensing pipelines exhibit a multiplicative bias of several percent 
that is stable as a function of redshift. This level of shape measurement bias does not have a statistically
significant impact on simulated stage III optical weak lensing cluster
cosmology survey, such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) on cluster cosmology, and can be further reduced by simulation based calibration.

\section{Introduction}
The abundances and masses of galaxy clusters provide an important constraint on 
cosmology \citep{obscos}. Weak lensing is one of the most direct ways to measure cluster
masses for large optical surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES)
(http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), which due to its depth and
survey area will very accurately measure the halo mass function.
Measuring the correlated distortion in the shapes of galaxies caused by lensing is complicated
by the distortion of observed images caused by the atmosphere and telescope optics, called the 
Point Spread Function or PSF. Shape measurement pipelines have been developed to remove the 
effect of the PSF and accurately measure the lensing signal. As the
mass measured from a galaxy cluster depends on the strength of the
shear measured on galaxies behind the cluster, a biased weak lensing
pipeline will lead to a biased determination of the cluster mass.
 
\indent Previous image simulation challenges were used to determine
the accuracy of shape measurement pipelines, STEP1 \citep{STEP1},
STEP2 \citep{STEP2}, GREAT08 \citep{GREAT08}, GREAT10
\citep{GREAT10}, \citep{great3}, and used blinded image
simulations to characterize the shape measurement bias created by
different lensing pipelines. All of these challenges have focused on
different aspects of shear estimation, and they have lead to
improvements in existing shear pipelines. These simulation challenges provide a way to
more directly compare the accuracy of shear measurement pipelines against each other
on simulated data with different properties. Results from these challenges have been
used to calibrate shape measurement pipelines \citep[e.g.][]{Apple},
and determine that lensing pipelines meet accuracy requirements for scientific
analysis \citep[e.g.][]{Berge}. The most recent image challenge, the
GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing challenge, (GREAT3) was
designed to test the impact of realistic galaxy morphology, the effect
of measureing shear on data that is the result of combining multiple
exposures, and the impact of estimating a varying PSF from
stars. Although GREAT3 provides valuable information on many important
aspects of shear pipeline estimation, it was only designed to test the ability of shear
pipelines to measure shear with a maximum value $|g_{true}| \leq 0.05
$, and it is important to also test the accuracy of shape measurement
pipelines in the higher shear regime that occurs around the center of
massive galaxy clusters.
\indent
The Cluster Shear TEsting Program (CSTEP) is designed to extend image
simulation challenges to the high shear regime, and study how aspects of
shear estimation that would impact a weak lensing measurement of
cluster mass for a ground based large optical survey. For this project CSTEP tested
simulated ground-based data, that contained galaxies with a realistic
distribution of signal-to-noise, size and ellipticity. This project
then estimated the error on the cluster mass measurement for a
large optical survey that would be due to shape measurement bias.
CSTEP tested eight weak lensing pipelines on images of constant shear
($|\gamma| = [0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.15]$ ) with galaxy and PSF properties that simulate the properties
of data that will be observed with a large ground based optical survey
such as DES. Lensing pipelines
were evaluated to determine their shape measurement bias as a function
of several different simulated galaxy properties including Signal to
Noise (S/N), galaxy ellipticity and Redshift. The shape measurement bias as 
determined for each lensing pipelines was then used to model the 
expected systematic error in the cluster mass for a stacked weak lensing measurement.
\indent
In Section 2 we describe the structure of the challenge in greater detail and the image simulations used in this
project. We describe the characteristics of the shape
measurement pipelines used in this analysis in Section 3. We present
findings on the impact of S/N, selection effects and
Redshift on measurement bias and efficiency in Section 4. The
discussion of how shape measurement biases on data used for stacked cluster weak lensing analysis would affect
the mass of halos measured for a simulated weak lensing
survey is contained in Section 5.  A summary of the conclusions from this study are discussed in
Section 6.  Finally there is an appedix which contains some further
discussion of pipeline methods. 

\section{Cluster STEP Challege}
Gravitational lensing refers to the distortion in the images of
distant galaxies observed after the light they emit is
effected by the graviational pull of massive structures. This can
cause a change in the observed shape, size, and brightness of a
galaxy. For massive galaxy clusters this leads to galaxies at a
higher redshift than the cluster often being
observed as arcs ( strong lensing ) near the cluster center , and to
appear aligned tangentialy with decreasing amount of distortion further from
the cluster center ( weak lensing ). Since galaxies are assumed to
have random orientations, a measurement of the average ellipticity of
a group of galaxies unaffected by gravitational lensing would average
to zero. Measuring the degree in which the observed galaxies appear aligned so
the ensemble average ellipticity diverges from zero, provides a way to 
measure the strength of the gravitational lensing signal, and thus the
mass of the galaxy cluster. 
\indent For the
larger shears of the cluster regime both the quadratic ($q$) and
multiplicative ($m$) shape measurement bias (cf Eq.~\ref{Eqn:QMC})
affect the bias in lensing signal to a greater extent than any
constant ($c$) shear bias which is an order of magnitude smaller. It is
important to quantify the quadratic and multiplicative bias on images
with simulated shear comparable to the shear observed around large
galaxy clusters. The Cluster Shear TEsting Program (CSTEP) tested eight weak lensing pipelines on images of constant shear
($|\gamma| = [0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.15]$ ) with galaxy and PSF properties that simulate the properties
of data that will be observed with DES. Systematic shape measurement bias was quantified by the $q$, $m$ and $c$
determined by a fit of the quadratic equation.
\begin{equation}\label{Eqn:QMC}
\gamma_m = q (\gamma_t)^2 + (1+m) \gamma_t + c,
\end {equation}
where $\gamma_t$ is the true shear and $\gamma_m$ is the measured
shear. A simpler model that has been used to quantify error
for cosmic shear regimes.
\begin{equation}\label{Eqn:MC}
\gamma_m = (1+m) \gamma_t + c,
\end {equation}

\section{Evaluation of pipelines}
In this section we evaluate the performance of shape measurement 
pipelines based on a set of criteria important for large cluster weak
lensing studies. The success of a shape measurement pipeline depends
on its ability to accurately measure shear on small faint galaxies, be unbiased
when all galaxies present in an image are used to measure the shear, and
have a shear bias that does not change as a function of the redshift
of the galaxies included in the lensing measurement. A good shape
measurement method would also be able to successfully measure shear on
a high percentage of the galaxy images which it attempts to analyze. 
The relative importance of the above criteria in determining
the best shear measurement pipeline to use may depend both on the 
data being evaluated and the lensing application. A more detailed examination
of the performance of each individual lensing pipeline 
as a function of PSF ellipticity, PSF size, galaxy size, 
and selection bias is included in Appendix \ref{App:shpipe}, along
with a description of the algorithms of the shape measurement pipelines. \\

\section{Stacked cluster weak lensing}
An accurate measurement of the abundance of galaxy clusters within a
given survey volume provides powerful constraints on cosmological
parameters.  While weak lensing can provide individual mass
measurements of high mass clusters, lower mass clusters can only be
measured on average by stacked weak lensing. Stacked weak lensing
measures the mean tangential shear of  background galaxies behind
galaxy clusters which are binned by observable parameters such as
richness. Stacked weak lensing
of clusters in the MaxBCG catalog \citep{Koester, Eshel} on data from the 
Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep{York} has been used to derive
cosmological constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ in
\citep{Ying, ERozo}. Since upcoming surveys such as DES  will include deeper
imaging and better seeing, the constraints on cosmology
from stacked cluster weak lensing will substantially improve if
sources of systematic error can be controlled. \\
\indent There are a number of systematic effects that can bias the
stacked weak lensing mass measurement, and in this paper we focus
on studying the systematic bias in the stacked weak lensing cluster
mass measurement contributed by shape measurement errors. If lensing
pipelines provide a biased measurement of the shear profile of galaxy
clusters this will bias the observed average cluster mass, and bias
the derived cluster abundance function. To model the possible
impact on a DES like survey by shape measurement errors, we take an
average NFW profile for each stacked cluster bin, apply a lensing
bias, and then determine what cluster mass would be measured by
an NFW fitting program. By comparing the true and the measured cluster
mass this provides an estimate of the effect of shape measurement bias
for each lensing pipeline. In this paper we compare the expected statistical errors
expected in a DES like survey stacked weak lensing cluster mass measurement
described in section \ref{sec:p1} to the modeled bias on the mass
from shape measurement errors described in section \ref{sec:p2}. \\
\indent There are several other significant sources of systematic bias for
stacked weak lensing not included in this study. As shown by
\citep{Joerg} if optically detected clusters are binned by richness
they have orientation bias and are not spherically symmetric, which
leads to bias in the measured cluster abundance. Currently
orientation bias will dominate over the statistical error for DES but
it can perhaps be calibrated using simulations, or corrected using
other methods. There are additional sources of possible systematic
error such as photometric errors and cluster miscentering which are 
areas of ongoing research and not discussed in this project.

\section{Summary}
The CSTEP project tested shape measurement pipelines in the cluster
shear regime on simulated data of the Dark Energy Survey. This project
analyzed the effectiveness of the shear pipelines by several criteria,
and tested the impact shape measurement bias would have on a stacked
cluster weak lensing analysis. \\
\indent In this paper we measured Quadratic, Multiplicative and
Additive bias of galaxy shape estimates for eight shape measurement
pipelines. The shape measurement bias found in several of the pipelines was within the
desired limits of a stacked cluster weak lensing measurement for
DES. In particular the I3 pipeline has consistently good bias properties
across a wide range of simulation input parameters.\\
\indent The results on the simulations showed that the strongest
determination of high bias was a low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). A
low signal to noise ratio occurs when the differentiation between
galaxy boundaries and their background is poor. In contrast, galaxies 
simulated at different redshifts had the same level of bias. An
important finding is based on an analysis of bias as a function of galaxy model
type. For many of the pipelines, and I3 in particular, galaxy
model type has little impact on measures of pipeline bias. \\
\indent The results showed that in general the Quadratic bias was not
significant for most pipelines and that it did not contribute
significantly to the error in the mass measured on stacked cluster
weak lensing profiles. \\
\indent This project has helped determine the properties of pipelines
to be used in the Dark Energy Survey. The use of the I3 pipeline
finds support by the consistently high quality of the shape
estimates. In addition, the characteristics of bias have been further
clarified, leaving in general bias as a multiplicative function
dominated by Signal to Noise ratio - leading to support of future
multiplicative corrections for Signal to Noise ratio in future
analysis. \\
