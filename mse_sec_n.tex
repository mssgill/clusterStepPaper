Here we model the systematic errors on the stacked cluster weak
lensing measurement by comparing the average mass in each bin
to the mass measured by a shear profile, affected by shape 
measurement bias. To measure the effect of shape measurement bias, a \citet*{1997ApJ...490..493N} (NFW) density profile is created for each mass bin. This density profile is
used to calculate the tangential reduced shear $g$ as described in \cite{NFW}. \\

\green{I don't think we need this}
\indent The NFW density profile is given by
\begin{equation}
\rho(r) = \frac{\delta_c\rho_c}{(r/r_s)(1+ r/r_s)^{2}}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_c = \frac{3 H^2 (z) }{8 \pi G} $ is the critical density , $
H(z) $ is Hubble's parameter , $G$ is Newton's constant, $r_s =
r_{200}/c$, $c$ is the concentration and 
\begin{equation}
\delta_c = \frac{200}{3}\frac{c^3}{ln(1+c) - c/(1+c)}
\end{equation}
from \citep{NFW} . The reduced shear from a NFW
halo is 
\begin{equation}
g = \frac{\gamma}{1-\kappa} = \frac{ \Delta \Sigma / \Sigma_c }{1
-\overline{\Sigma}/ \Sigma_c}
\end{equation}
\fi

The reduced shear as measured including shape bias is modeled as 
\begin{equation}
g' = (1+m)g + qg^2 \; .
\end{equation}
We then fit this $ g' $ distribution to get a $M_{200}$ and $ c $
value. \green{need more details here ... I guess sources uniformly distributed in area over some range in radius, maximum likelihood?}

\green{interpretation of results; note that even if the systematic offset is within the statistical uncertainties in each bin, all bins combinedly being measured low is a different story... at least need to discuss that}
