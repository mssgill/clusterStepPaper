In this section we discuss the importance of quadratic shape measurement 
bias on a representative DES lensing catalog of 
all sources with SNR $>$ 20. 

\green{added this interpretation:} As shown in the top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:QMC}, quadratic biases of the pipelines tested in this work are at the level of or below $|q|\approx0.1$. Even at the larges shear tested ($\gamma_t=0.15$), this corresponds to a relatively minor bias compared to the typical level of multiplicative biases, i.e.~$|q|\gamma_t^2\ll|m|\gamma_t$. Quadratic biases are therefore a sub-dominant contribution to systematic errors in shape measurement for the pipelines tested. An exception may be the case of GM, which shows a small multiplicative but relatively large quadratic bias for the three-parameter fit.
